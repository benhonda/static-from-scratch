# Build static websites _fast_ with Static-from-scratch :rocket:

Static-from-scratch is a repo that you can use as a starting point for your next static website. It's like starting from scratch without having to totally start from scratch.

- Gives your project a tried-and-true structure that you can build off of
- Generates production code that is:
  - Clean & concise
  - Lightweight
  - SEO conscious
  - Ready to deploy
- Extracts hard-coded data (like copy) into yaml files to make content changes and localization easy to manage and maintain
- Works with templating languages ([Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) by default)
- Includes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Alpine JS](https://alpinejs.dev/) out-of-the-box for easy styling and interactivity
- Stays out of your way as you build your website

## Roadmap

- Add config to ship on AWS (along with helpers for assets like images)
- Add documentation
- Create a better way to start with a **clean** project (maybe CLI one day?)
- More gulp automation:
  - resizing images

## Get started

Getting started is as easy as:

### 1. Fork

### 2. Run

One line and you're ready to go.

```bash
# from your root directory
npm install && npm start
```

Your browser should open a localhost window automatically.
