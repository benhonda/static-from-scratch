# Nunjucks-Gulp-Tailwind-Alpine starter

A bare bones project template that helps you build static sites **fast**.

## Get started

1. Clone or download the repo
1. Install dependencies

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

1. Spin up a server and run all Gulp tasks

  ```bash
  gulp watch
  ```

## The deets

1. English content goes into [locales/en.json](src/locales/en.json). French content goes into [locales/fr.json](src/locales/en.json). You use the same variable nam (json key) in both of these files. See [pages/index.njk](src/pages/index.njk)
